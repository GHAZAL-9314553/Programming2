# Programming2
The purpose of this assignment is to create a simple model of the photosynthesis process through the implementation of various classes and their interactions. The assignment consists of three main tasks:

Assignment 1: the Atom class

Creating a class called Atom to represent any atom in the periodic table.
Implementing methods to retrieve the number of protons and the mass number of an atom.
Handling isotope functionality by allowing the number of neutrons to be modified.
Defining comparison methods for isotopes of the same element based on their mass numbers.

Assignment 2: the Molecule class

Creating a class called Molecule to represent a neutral group of atoms.
Initializing a molecule with a list of tuples containing Atom objects and the number of atoms of each type.
Implementing a printable representation of a molecule.
Defining a method to combine two molecules into a new molecule.

Assignment 3: The Chloroplast class

Creating a class called Chloroplast to simulate the photosynthesis process.
Managing the addition of water and carbon dioxide molecules to the chloroplast.
Triggering photosynthesis when specific conditions are met and producing sugar and oxygen molecules.
Providing a printable representation of the chloroplast, showing the number of stored water and carbon dioxide molecules.
The assignment emphasizes adhering to the SOLID principles and encourages identifying possible improvements and refactoring opportunities in the codebase. It suggests considering the use of constants and separating static elements from those that may change. The final task is to write a README.md file that documents the identified improvements and suggestions for the codebase.
