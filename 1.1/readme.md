The purpose of this assignment is to analyze a codebase and evaluate its adherence to certain software design principles and concepts. The assignment involves several exercises, each focusing on a different aspect of the code. The exercises include:

Exercise 1: The factory
- Understanding the concept of a factory in software development.
- Evaluating whether the implementation of the factory method follows the Interface Segregation Principle.

Exercise 2: Single responsibility
- Reviewing the Python files related to the CCS classification.
- Assessing whether these files adhere to the single-responsibility principle.

Exercise 3: The base classes
- Identifying examples of the Liskov substitution principle in the code.
- Explaining how functions using base classes can work with objects of derived classes without knowing it.

Exercise 4: The local settings object
- Examining the implementation of the Settings class as a singleton object.
- Analyzing whether the singleton object follows the SOLID principles.
- Evaluating the logicality of storing hospital types codes in a separate Python module.
- Considering alternative solutions for managing local settings and parameters.

Exercise 5: UML Class diagram
- Creating a UML class diagram for the program to visualize its class structure.
