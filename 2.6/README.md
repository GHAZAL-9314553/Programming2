# Programming2
The purpose of this assignment is to analyze the code of one of our classmates, apply the principles of good software discussed during the plenary part, and provide a report with our findings. The report should include a thorough description of the code base, its intended purpose, organization, scalability, and maintainability. Additionally, we are required to suggest at least one non-trivial refactor that would improve the code base, explaining the current state of the code and the proposed refactor.

In Assignment 2, we are asked to read the article "Software Engineering for Machine Learning: Characterizing and Detecting Mismatch in Machine-Learning Systems" by Lewis and Ozkaya (2021). Our task is to summarize the article, specifically focusing on the different types of mismatches identified by the authors. We should try to provide concrete examples of these mismatches from our own projects or experiences.

Furthermore, we need to read the article "Tackling Collaboration Challenges in the Development of ML-Enabled Systems" by Lewis (2023) and provide a summary. In this summary, we should discuss how we envision our cooperation as a (future) data scientist with software engineers and explain how we plan to make our code scalable, readable, and maintainable. If we have prior experience putting code into production, we should describe those experiences as well.
