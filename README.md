# Programming2

programming2_portfolio

About the portfolio: This portfolio showcases nine assignments from the programming 2 course, each focusing on different methods and concepts within the field of programming.
every assignment has its folder and its read me spicifically.

By completing Assignment 1.1 and documenting our findings in the README file, we will demonstrate our understanding of software design principles and our ability to analyze and evaluate code quality.  

 Assignment 1.2 The purpose of this assignment is to create a simple model of the photosynthesis process through the implementation of various classes and their interactions. 

 Assignment 1.3 The purpose of this assignment is to build a relatively complex system that involves multiple classes working together to process and analyze temperature anomaly data.
 
 Assignment 1.4 The purpose of this assignment is to explore and practice concepts related to generators, list comprehensions, and code refactoring. The exercises focus on improving code readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

 Assignment 2.1 The purpose of this assignment is to gain practical experience in implementing a client-server architecture and understanding the concepts of asynchronous programming.

Assignment 2.2 purpose of this assignment is to introduce the concept of parallelization and demonstrate its benefits in terms of performance improvement when dealing with time-consuming tasks such as harvesting and downloading large amounts of data.

Assignment 2.3 The overall purpose of this assignment is to familiarize  with Dask and Dask-ML, understanding how to leverage parallel computing capabilities to perform efficient data processing and machine learning tasks.
