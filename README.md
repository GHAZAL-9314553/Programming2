# Programming2

programming2_portfolio

About the portfolio: This portfolio showcases nine assignments from the programming 2 course, each focusing on different methods and concepts within the field of programming.
every assignment has its folder and its read me spicifically.

    In Assignment 1, I explored common preprocessing steps and their relevance, provided tutorials on clustering methods and scanpy objects, and explained the appropriate visualization methods chosen for each tutorial. also in Bonus part I have done that for the scanpy tutorial on breast cancer dataset .

    In Assignment 2, I analyze the similarities between a notebook and an article titled "Clinical Documents Clustering Based on Medication/Symptom Names Using Multi-View Nonnegative Matrix Factorization," and outline the additional components required in the notebook to reproduce the article's findings.

    In Assignment 3, I utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically anomaly detection, to employ multiple predictive models and evaluate their accuracy in differentiating between normal payment transactions and fraudulent ones for credit card fraud detection.

    In Assignment 4, I analyzed housing data by visualizing it, implemented a cost function for linear regression, optimized model parameters using gradient descent, and explored different combinations of learning rates and iterations for minimizing the cost.

    Assignment 5 involves analyzing and comparing the decision boundaries and support vectors of different Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models with various kernels on the moon dataset. By executing the provided code, you can visualize and understand how different kernels behave on this specific dataset.

    In Assignment 6 I utilizeD a decision tree model on a heart disease database. It uses factors such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and others to predict whether people have heart disease or not. The code includes data inspection, data visualization, and the implementation of a decision tree model for prediction.

    In assignment 7, I implemented a code that performs data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training and evaluation using ensemble models such as Bagging (Random Forest) and AdaBoost. The code also provides flexibility to experiment with different configurations, such as adjusting the number of estimators for the Random Forest classifier.
