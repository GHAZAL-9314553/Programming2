# Programming2
The purpose of this assignment is to explore and practice concepts related to generators, list comprehensions, and code refactoring. The exercises focus on improving code readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Here's a summary of each exercise:

Exercise 1: Refactoring your own code
- The objective is to replace for-loops in the previous week's exercise with list comprehensions.
- By using list comprehensions, the code becomes more concise, readable, and Pythonic.
- The refactoring should not affect the functionality of the code, and assert statements can be used to ensure correctness.

Exercise 2: Functions with data
- Create a function that takes a list of data and a function as parameters.
- Apply the given function to each value in the data list and return a new list with the transformed values.
- Enhance the function to accept an arbitrary number of functions, returning a list of lists for each function applied to the data.
- Utilize list comprehensions to simplify the implementation.

Exercise 3: Refactoring other people's code
- Download and analyze the provided webcrawler.py script.
- Start by refactoring the code to improve maintainability and reusability.
- Create a Crawler class and move the code into methods within the class.
- Implement a crawl_site() method as the main loop and make it an instance method.
- Create a separate main.py file to import the Crawler class, create an instance, and call the crawl_site() method.
- Replace lambda expressions with list comprehensions.
- These improvements contribute to better code organization and separation of concerns.

Step 2: Change the loop into an iterator
- Modify the crawl_site() method to use an internal pointer in the Crawler class.
- Implement an iterator using __iter__() and __next__() methods.
- Initialize the internal pointer and refactor the loop in crawl_site() accordingly.
- Verify the correctness of the implementation by running test code.

Step 3: Make use of a generator
- Implement the __iter__() method in the Crawler class to create a generator.
- Each call to the iterator should return the next crawled website.
- Test the generator behavior by using a few calls to the __iter__() method with the help of the zip function.

Step 4: Come up with enhancements
- Analyze the code and identify potential refactoring candidates based on the SOLID principles discussed during the first session.
- Add a small piece of text to the repository that analyzes the code and suggests possible enhancements based on SOLID principles.

The overall purpose of this assignment is to improve code quality, apply best practices, and deepen understanding of generators, list comprehensions, and code refactoring techniques.
